# UFC Fight Pass Bugs

The official UFC Fight Pass app is easily the buggiest app I've got running on my AppleTV and iOS devices. While the content is excellent, the entire experience usability experience is extremely frustrating. 

Using these apps is akin to being repeatedly punched in the back of the head by someone who's spindly little arms are too weak to truly hurt you, but just strong enough for it to be incessantly annoying.

This repository is to track those bugs so I can stop fuming about them every time I encounter them.
