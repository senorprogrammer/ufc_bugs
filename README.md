# UFC Fight Pass Bugs

The official UFC Fight Pass app is by far the buggiest app I've got running on my AppleTV and iOS devices. While the content is excellent, the entire usability experience is poor. 

This repository is to track those bugs so I can stop fuming about them every time I encounter them.
